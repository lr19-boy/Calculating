        <h2> Calculations </h2>
        <p>
            An electronic calculator is typically a portable electronic
            device used to perform calculations, ranging from basic arithmetic
            to complex mathematics. The first solid-state electronic calculator
            was created in the early 1960s. <br> Pocket-sized
            devices became available in the 1970s, especially after the
            Intel 4004, the first microprocessor, was developed by Intel for the
            Japanese calculator company Busicom. Modern electronic calculators
            vary from cheap, give-away, <br> credit-card-sized models to sturdy desktop
            models with built-in printers. They became popular in the mid-1970s
            as the incorporation of integrated circuits reduced their size and
            cost. By the end of that decade, prices had dropped to the point where
            a basic calculator was affordable to most and they became common in
            schools. Computer operating systems as far back as early Unix have
            included interactive calculator programs such as dc and hoc, and
            interactive BASIC could be <br> used to do calculations on most 1970s and
            1980s home computers. Calculator functions are included in most
            personal digital assistant (PDA) type devices. In addition to general
            purpose calculators, there are those designed for <br> specific markets.
            For example, there are scientific calculators which include
            trigonometric and statistical calculations. Some calculators even have
            the ability to do computer algebra. Graphing calculators can be used
            to graph functions <br> defined on the real line, or higher-dimensional
            Euclidean space. As of 2016, basic calculators cost little, but
            scientific and graphing models tend to cost more. With the very wide
            availability of smartphones, tablet computers and personal computers,
            dedicated hardware calculators, while still widely used, are less
            common than they once were. In 1986, calculators still represented
            an estimated 41% of the world's general-purpose hardware capacity
            to compute information. By 2007, this had diminished to less than 0.05%.
